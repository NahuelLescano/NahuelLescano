# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nahuel.

I am a passionate Full Stack Developer and Programmer Analyst, with a background in Computer Engineering. I have a strong ability to adapt quickly and learn new technologies and languages on the go.

## Education ðŸŽ“

Studied Full Stack Development at Henry Bootcamp during this year.
Currently pursuing System Analysis at ORT Argentina.
Previously studied Informatics Engineering at Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA).

## Projects ðŸš€

### Rick and Morty Web Page
I've been working on a web page dedicated to the popular show Rick and Morty. The project involved using React, Redux, and pure CSS for frontend development. On the backend, I utilized Express.js and Sequelize to manage data. It was an incredible learning experience, and I'm proud to have completed it!

### Dog Project

I also took on a solo project centered around dogs. Similar to the Rick and Morty web page, I used React, Redux, and pure CSS for frontend development. On the backend, I implemented Express.js and Sequelize. This project allowed me to further enhance my skills and knowledge as a developer.

### E-Commerce Project

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting e-commerce project called Bodu Games. On the backend, we leveraged Express, Node.js, and Sequelize to handle data and business logic. For the frontend, we used Vite + React, Redux, and Chakra UI, complemented by pure CSS. The collaborative effort taught me the value of teamwork and communication in a development environment.

## Goals and Aspirations ðŸŒŸ

I am actively seeking my first programming job to apply and expand my expertise. My journey as a developer has been incredible so far, and I am eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to meaningful projects. I'm open to new opportunities and challenges that allow me to showcase my skills and contribute to innovative solutions.
